# **App Name**: Zync

## Core Features:

- Feature Grid: Showcase the key features of Zync with a visually appealing grid layout, including icons, titles, and descriptions. Highlight the unique selling points, such as visual tunnel management and portability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Light Theme: Primary background: White (#ffffff); Secondary background: Light gray (#f9fafb); Accent color: Blue (#3B82F6).
- Dark Theme: Primary background: Dark gray (#09090b); Secondary background: Darker gray (#18181b); Accent color: Blue (#3B82F6).
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and clean look. Using the same font for headers and body copy keeps the website consistent and clean, which matches the prompt's ask for 'clean and minimal'.
- Use 'Lucide React' icons for a consistent and modern visual style throughout the application. Icon styles will be kept monochromatic and should match the active theme.
- Maintain a clean, minimal layout with generous white space and a dotted grid background pattern. The layout should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- Implement smooth animations and micro-interactions using Framer Motion, such as fade-in effects, hover lift effects, and smooth color transitions, with a duration of 200-300ms.
